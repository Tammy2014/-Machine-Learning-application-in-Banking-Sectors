#  Machine-Learning-application-in-Banking-Sectors 

## Introduction:

      ### A Pseudo bank is interested in expanding the borrowers base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests
      ### and has scored limited increase rate. The bank now interested to develop machine learning model to identify potential
      ### borrowers to support focused marketing. A sample dataset containing Quasi: ID: Customer ID, Age Customer’s approximate
      ### age, CustomerSince: Customer of the bank since, HighestSpend, ZipCode,  HiddenScore , MonthlyAverageSpend, Mortgage, 
      ### Security Customer’s security asset, FixedDepositAccount, Internet Banking. At total of 1000 rows and 12 columns.

## Goal:

      ### The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to identify potential borrowers to support focused marketing using banking system.
                            
## Approaches: 

      ### Performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis Importing the dataset and required libraries. Removal of unwanted features and missing data handling
      ### if required, using appropriate methods. 5. Checking data distribution using statistical techniques.  Using python
      ### libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for data interpretation and advanced visualizations. 
      ### Splitting Dataset into Train and Test using sklearn.  Training a model using Classification techniques
      ### like Logistics Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine. 
      
## Technology: 
      ### Language - Python Libraries – numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, pickle, imblearn 
      
## Models Tested:  

###  •	Logistic Regression Model 
      ###  •	Weighted Logistic Regression Model 
      ###  •	Naive Bayes Model 
      ###  •	Support Vector Machine Model
      ###  •	Decision Tree Classifier
      ###  •	Random Forest Classifier
